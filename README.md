## Running Code

In this code, you can run our models on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet dataset.

### Score Generation

```shell
python score_generation.py \
--pretrain_dir [pre-trained model dir] \
--arch [model arch name] \
--limit [batch numbers] \
--alpha [balancing hyperparamter] \
```
This script generates the scores for all channels in each conv layer. The scores are indicative of the channels perofrmance and how much information it can contribute. Based on the compressionr rate specified in the evaluation, our framework selects the top k channels ranked in descending order by their scores.


### Model Training

For the ease of reproducibility. we provide some of the experimental results and the corresponding pruned rate of every layer directly from our paper below:
#### Attention! The actual pruning rates are much higher than these presented in the paper since we do not count the next-layer channel removal (For example, if 50 filters are removed in the first layer, then the corresponding 50 channels in the second-layer filters should be removed as well).

##### 1. VGG-16

## GradCam Visualizations


![Alt text](./figs/GradCam.png)
*This figure shows 3 images sampled from ImageNet [7] with attention maps overlayed for both the Original and CFDP pruned versions of the ResNet-50 architecture. Despite the significant pruning of the architecture by almost 50% in parameters, it is able to create a reduced n-dimensional embedding space that retains the importance of feature recognition from the original 512-dimensional embedding space (and in some cases, improves it). Refer to the main paper for more information.*
